\section{Project overview and data
collection}\label{project-overview-and-data-collection}}

This is an exploratory observational study to understand what factors
drive systemic crises (financial instability) in 13 African countries.

The primary data was obtained as a mostly clean data set from Kaggle:
\url{https://www.kaggle.com/chirin/africa-economic-banking-and-systemic-crisis-data}.

From Kaggle: ``The dataset is a derivative of Reinhart et al's Global
Crises dataset. It was downloaded from:
\url{https://www.hbs.edu/behavioral-finance-and-financial-stability/data/Pages/global.aspx}
Non-African countries were filtered out from the dataset. And, variables
containing notes or sparse data were removed. Years with no data were
also filtered out\ldots The dataset specifically focuses on the Banking,
Debt, Financial, Inflation and Systemic Crises that occurred, from 1860
to 2014, in 13 African countries, including: Algeria, Angola, Central
African Republic, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco,
Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.''

Additional Commodity Import \& Export Price Index data was web scraped
from and added to the primary data set:
\url{https://data.imf.org/?sk=2CDDCCB8-0B59-43E9-B6A0-59210D5605D2\&sId=1390030341854}

From Commodity of Terms of Trade: Commodity Import/Export Price Index,
Individual Commodities Weighted by Ratio of Imports to GDP Historical,
Annual (1965-present), Fixed Weights, Index(2012=100)

\hypertarget{objectives-and-interests}{%
\section{Objectives and interests}\label{objectives-and-interests}}

We seek to answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  What patterns and trends are associated with systemic crises?
\item
  What economic factors drive systemic crises? Which have the most (or
  least) effect? How do these differ by country?
\item
  How do non-economic factors, such as independence from colonial rule,
  affect systemic crises?
\item
  How well do models based on data from these African countries predict
  systemic crises in other countries in Africa or other continents?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{class-material-to-be-used-for-the-analysis}{%
\section{Class material to be used for the
analysis}\label{class-material-to-be-used-for-the-analysis}}

The analysis and presentation will be created using RMarkdown as a
powerful communication tool. We make use of several data types including
various vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, and tibbles. Web scraping
makes use of strings and regular expressions. Data transformations are
done using dplyr and visualizations are done using ggplot2. Our
regression analysis makes use of techniques from model
fitting/optimization, functions of functions, and bootstrapping
confidence intervals for regression coefficients. We expect to conduct a
logistic regression given that our outcome of interest is a binary
variable indicating the presence of a systemic crisis for a particular
year and country. If time allows, we plan to make use of sampling
methods and Monte Carlo simulation tools.

\section{Responsibilities}\label{responsibilities}}

Declan - Web scraping, data transformation, sampling, Monte Carlo,
Bootstrapping

Said - Data collection, economic research, exploratory data analysis
including correlation analyses

Rakeen - Regression, Bootstrapping, GitHub, RMarkdown, exploratory data
analyses and hypothesis testing

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

We expect to identify economic, political, and regional variables that
have a significant effect on systemic crises as well as variables that
do not have any effect. The results will indicate further data
collection and analysis that can be performed for future investigation.
